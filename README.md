# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

I was able to pull in a list of random cities from cities.py the search for those cities on our weather website. I tyhen used the temperature, humidity and coudiness information to plot some graphs. My observations are below.
1. Temperature increases as Latutude gets closer to 0 but moreso for the Northern Hemisphere.
2. Humidity only has a mild correlation with Latitude.
3. Coudiness is reported in clumps which shows horizontal lines on the scatter plot. This means that the reporting of cloudiness is not very flexible to what is actually happening or just not important enough for most reporters to deliniate to single intigers. 

Once I had this data I made sure it was clean and created some heat maps using gmaps that show where the cities were, how humid they were and how clustered they were. Finally I narrowed down the list of cities severly so that I would only have ythe ones that were perfect candidates for a vacation. 
The first screen shot is of the heat map made with all of the cities included.
The second screen shot has the markers added and only the cities that would be perfect for a vacation. 

If I were to continue working with this data I would pull in the most searched vacation destinations, record what their weather is like as well as geolocation and seasonal tendencies. I would then try to create a profile of what makes these places enjoyable to be at from a weather perspective. With this I would search for less popular plasces that still met all of the criteria so that I would have places that were for all weather related conditions equally as perfect as the most popular vacation destinations.
